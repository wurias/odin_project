        The best things in life are often the simplest — and this fresh cranberry sauce, <br>made with just three ingredients, is proof.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries <br> (such as Ocean Spray®)</li>        
    </ul>    
    <h2>Directions</h2>    
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.
        </li> <br>

        <li>Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. <br>Reduce heat to low, and simmer until cranberries have popped and sauce is chunky, <br>about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. <br>The longer you cook it, the less chunky it will be.</li> <br>

        <li>Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use; <br>the pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as it cools.
        </li> <br>

        <li>Mix cranberry sauce with a fork before serving.</li>
    </ol>
